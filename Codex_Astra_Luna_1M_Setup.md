# Codex Astra + Luna Model-Max Context Setup

A minimal Codex multi-agent setup using **Astra as the primary orchestrator** and **Luna as the only delegated worker model**.

The design goals are:

- Keep orchestration and hard technical decisions in Astra.
- Use Luna for exploration, implementation, debugging, testing, and review.
- Dispatch independent Luna work in explicit same-wave batches, starting small and expanding only when independence and resources support it.
- Select Luna reasoning effort by task complexity instead of running every task at `max`.
- Reuse relevant Luna context across investigation, implementation, and verification.
- Avoid unnecessary Sol/Terra handoffs and duplicated high-cost context.
- Request the global context and compaction defaults for Astra and all five Luna roles; the current model catalog may clamp those requests.

> The global Codex configuration requests `model_context_window = 1_000_000` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900_000` as the default. All five canonical Luna roles inherit these settings. The current local model catalog may clamp the request to `max_context_window = 872_000` with an effective runtime compaction limit of `828_400`.

## Architecture

```text
Astra main/native (global default request)
├─ Luna Low      → file/symbol lookup, narrow searches
├─ Luna Medium   → flow tracing, logs, dependency analysis
├─ Luna High     → small fixes, routine tests
├─ Luna Max      → substantive implementation, difficult debugging
└─ Luna Review   → independent review
```

There is no mandatory `low → medium → high → max` pipeline. Pick the role that matches the task.

For difficult questions, Luna reports the unresolved issue back to the existing Astra session. Astra decides directly, then the same Luna worker can continue implementation and verification.

## Parallel dispatch contract

Treat the following as the Astra/Luna prompt-level execution contract:

- If Astra identifies two or more independent subtasks, Astra decomposes the work first and submits every independent Luna worker in the same dispatch wave. Do not use `spawn → wait → spawn` for independent subtasks.
- After all workers in a wave have been submitted, await and join their results as a batch. Send only work whose inputs depend on an earlier result in a later wave.
- Start with roughly 2–4 useful Luna workers. Expand only after independence and resource availability are confirmed, up to the existing `max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 12` ceiling. Do not fill all 12 by default.
- Give each write-enabled worker separate file/module ownership; concurrent edits to the same file are prohibited. Independent read-only searches and reviews should be parallelized when their scopes do not overlap.
- Reuse retained worker context across related investigation, implementation, testing, and revision stages, but do not use that reuse as a reason to serialize independent branches. Luna workers are leaves: use Luna only, with no Sol/Terra or Astra child.

This is prompt guidance rather than an automatic scheduler. Actual parallelism depends on the runtime submitting spawn calls concurrently. `max_concurrent_threads_per_session` is a concurrency ceiling; configuration alone does not create workers or make dispatch parallel.

---

## 1. Global `config.toml`

Merge the following into `~/.codex/config.toml` or the active Codex configuration.

```toml
model = "gpt-6-astra"
model_reasoning_effort = "low"
plan_mode_reasoning_effort = "low"
review_model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
model_context_window = 1_000_000
model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900_000

[agents]
enabled = true
default_subagent_model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
default_subagent_reasoning_effort = "medium"
max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 12
max_depth = 1
```

Notes:

- `max_depth = 1` is a legacy/V1 nesting constraint: it limits nested delegation but does not block sibling Luna workers from running in parallel. V2 may ignore it.
- The global context and compaction request applies to Astra and all five canonical Luna roles.
- The current local model catalog may clamp the request to `max_context_window = 872_000` with an effective runtime compaction limit of `828_400`.

---

## 2. Luna roles

Create these files under `~/.codex/agents/`.

These five role files intentionally omit `model_context_window` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit`; every canonical role inherits the global defaults from section 1. The local model catalog may clamp those inherited requests as described above.

## 3. Canonical role set

The active `~/.codex/agents/` directory contains exactly these five canonical Luna roles:

| Role | Effort | Context | Permissions |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `luna_low` | low | Global default | read-only |
| `luna_medium` | medium | Global default | read-only |
| `luna_high` | high | Global default | workspace-write |
| `luna_max` | max | Global default | workspace-write |
| `luna_review` | high | Global default | read-only |

Do not add compatibility aliases to the active role directory unless a specific caller still requires one.

---

## 4. `AGENTS.md` routing block

Add this block to the active global or project `AGENTS.md`.

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN ASTRA_LUNA_1M -->
## Astra + Luna routing

Astra is the main session and owns orchestration, hard technical decisions, integration, and final acceptance.
All delegated AI work uses Luna. Do not use Sol, Terra, or another Astra child.

For important repository work, delegate one coherent unit to an existing suitable Luna worker before broad exploration, implementation, debugging, or testing. Reuse a useful worker before creating a new one. Delegate even when only one task can be parallelized; delegate independent units in parallel. While Luna works, Astra does not repeat the same scope.

For two or more independent subtasks, Astra decomposes first and submits all independent Luna workers in one dispatch wave; do not use `spawn → wait → spawn` for independent work. After submission, batch-wait and join the results, and put only dependency-bound work in a later wave. Start with roughly 2–4 useful workers and expand toward the existing 12-thread ceiling only when independence and resources are confirmed; do not fill the ceiling by default. Do not create duplicate or ceremonial workers, and do not let workers edit the same file concurrently.

Choose the Luna role directly by task difficulty and permission needs:
- `luna_low`: low — exact searches and facts.
- `luna_medium`: medium — bounded flow/log/dependency analysis.
- `luna_high`: high — clear small fixes and routine tests.
- `luna_max`: max — substantive implementation and difficult debugging.
- `luna_review`: high — independent review with read-only permissions.

Do not run low → medium → high → max as mandatory stages.
A Luna max worker performs ordinary searches required by its implementation.
Luna workers are leaves and do not spawn subagents.

Prefer reusing the same Luna worker for related investigation, implementation, testing, and revisions.
Do not close a useful worker between phases of the same coherent task.
For unrelated or one-off work, start a fresh worker with only the needed task context.
Do not fill the global default context window simply because it is available.

When the spawn API exposes history controls, choose them intentionally:
- V2: `fork_turns = "none" | "all" | "<positive integer>"`
- V1: `fork_context = false | true`
Never send both forms in the same spawn call.

After two materially different failed approaches without progress, Luna reports the exact unresolved question to Astra.
Astra decides directly, then the same Luna worker continues implementation and verification.
Escalate security or data-loss risks immediately.

Astra may act directly only for simple answers, tiny obvious work, judgments requiring the full main-session context, or a concrete technical or permission blocker to delegation. Do not skip delegation merely because Astra can do the work.

Use a small useful number of independent workers.
Do not let multiple workers edit the same file concurrently.
Use independent review when it materially improves correctness; do not create ceremonial reviewers.
Do not claim unrun tests passed.

GitHub routing:
- Route important GitHub work to Luna/max by default: use `luna_max` for repository search, diff analysis, code or documentation changes, tests, GitHub CLI preparation, and issue/PR drafting; use `luna_review` for independent review. Dispatch independent GitHub units in the same wave under the parallel dispatch contract.
- Keep Astra to the minimum needed for task framing, final scope and safety approval, and execution of public repository creation, pushes, merges, and permission changes.
- Never publish secrets, local configuration, credentials, or an unreviewed backlog.
<!-- END ASTRA_LUNA_1M -->
```

## 5. Context strategy

The setup intentionally does **not** force every Luna task to start from empty context.

Recommended behavior:

| Situation | Context strategy |
|---|---|
| One-off file or symbol lookup | Fresh `luna_low` with minimal task context |
| Investigation → implementation → tests → revisions | Reuse the same Luna worker |
| Related parallel task | Inherit only useful history when supported |
| Unrelated task | Start fresh |
| Hard unresolved decision | Report the issue and evidence to Astra; do not add another manager model |

The goal is to minimize duplicated reasoning and re-exploration, not merely to minimize raw Luna input tokens.

---

## 6. Verification

After applying the configuration, verify:

1. Primary session requests the global `model_context_window = 1_000_000` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900_000` defaults.
2. Each canonical Luna role inherits those global context and compaction settings without role-specific overrides.
3. `luna_low` resolves to Luna/low.
4. `luna_max` resolves to Luna/max.
5. If the local catalog clamps the request, it reports `max_context_window = 872_000` and an effective runtime compaction limit of `828_400`.
6. Existing project/profile overrides do not silently replace the model or reasoning settings.
7. Sol/Terra are not selected by the routing configuration.

Do not use the model's self-reported identity as the only verification source; prefer actual session/model metadata when available.

---

## 7. Notes

- The global configuration requests `model_context_window = 1_000_000` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900_000`; all five Luna roles inherit those settings.
- The current local model catalog may clamp that request to `max_context_window = 872_000` with an effective runtime compaction limit of `828_400`.
- A requested context value does not guarantee that every Codex build/account exposes the full capacity.
- Prompt/cache reuse is conditional and should not be assumed from thread reuse alone.
- `AGENTS.md` is routing guidance, not a hard model allow-list or security boundary.
- Keep permissions, provider settings, MCP configuration, and unrelated project configuration unchanged unless you intentionally manage them separately.
