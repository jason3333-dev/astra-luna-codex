# Codex Astra + Luna Model-Max Context

A lightweight Codex multi-agent configuration built around two models only:

- **Astra** — orchestration, hard technical decisions, integration, final acceptance
- **Luna** — exploration, implementation, debugging, testing, and review

The setup avoids Sol/Terra handoff layers and instead reuses Luna context where it is useful.

## Why this setup

A common multi-agent pattern adds multiple model tiers between orchestration and implementation. That can duplicate context, repeat repository exploration, and add handoff overhead.

This configuration keeps the hierarchy simple:

```text
Astra main/native (global default)
├─ Luna Low      → search / lookup
├─ Luna Medium   → analysis
├─ Luna High     → small fixes / routine tests
├─ Luna Max      → implementation / difficult debugging
└─ Luna Review   → independent review
```

Luna is inexpensive enough that retaining useful working context can be more efficient than repeatedly rebuilding it. Astra stays focused on decisions that benefit from already having the main-session context.

## Features

- Astra as the single top-level orchestrator
- Luna-only delegated agents
- Global default request of `model_context_window = 1_000_000` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900_000`
- Five task-based Luna roles inheriting the global context and compaction default: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`, and `review`
- The local model catalog may clamp the request to `max_context_window = 872_000`, with an effective runtime compaction limit of `828_400`
- Context reuse across investigation → implementation → testing → revision
- No mandatory reasoning ladder
- No Sol/Terra escalation layer
- Separate read-only review roles

## Setup

See [Codex_Astra_Luna_1M_Setup.md](./Codex_Astra_Luna_1M_Setup.md).

At a minimum, the setup adds:

```toml
model = "gpt-6-astra"
model_reasoning_effort = "low"
plan_mode_reasoning_effort = "low"
review_model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
model_context_window = 1_000_000
model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900_000

[agents]
enabled = true
default_subagent_model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
default_subagent_reasoning_effort = "medium"
max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 12
```

The five role files under `~/.codex/agents/` inherit the global context and compaction settings above; they do not override either setting. The setup also defines Luna roles under:

```text
~/.codex/agents/
├── luna_low.toml
├── luna_medium.toml
├── luna_high.toml
├── luna_max.toml
├── luna_review.toml
```

## Role selection

| Role | Effort | Context | Use case |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `luna_low` | low | Global default | file/symbol lookup, exact searches |
| `luna_medium` | medium | Global default | flow tracing, logs, dependencies |
| `luna_high` | high | Global default | small fixes, routine tests |
| `luna_max` | max | Global default | substantive implementation, hard debugging |
| `luna_review` | high | Global default | independent review |

These are **task classes, not sequential stages**.

## Context policy

- Reuse an existing Luna worker for related work.
- Start fresh for unrelated one-off tasks.
- Do not force an empty context just to save inexpensive Luna input tokens.
- Do not fill the global default context window simply because it exists.
- If Luna reaches a genuinely hard unresolved decision, send the evidence back to Astra instead of adding another manager model.

## Parallel dispatch contract

Use this as prompt-level guidance for Astra's dispatch decisions:

- When Astra identifies two or more independent subtasks, decompose them first and submit all independent Luna workers in the same dispatch wave.
- Do not use `spawn → wait → spawn` for independent work. After all workers in a wave are submitted, await and join their results as a batch; send only work with a true predecessor dependency in a later wave.
- Start with roughly 2–4 useful Luna workers. Expand toward the existing `max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 12` ceiling only when independence and resource availability are confirmed; do not fill all 12 by default.
- Give each write-enabled worker disjoint file/module ownership, and never allow concurrent edits to the same file. Independent read-only searches and reviews may also run in parallel.
- Reuse retained worker context across related stages, but do not use context reuse as a reason to serialize independent branches. Luna workers are leaves: use Luna only, with no Sol/Terra or Astra child.

This contract is a prompt recommendation, not an automatic scheduler. Its effect depends on the runtime submitting spawn calls concurrently; a parallelism setting alone does not create workers or dispatch work automatically.

## GitHub routing

- Important GitHub work is explicitly delegated to an existing suitable Luna worker before broad exploration, implementation, debugging, or testing; when multiple units are independent, submit them in the same dispatch wave and reuse useful workers when possible.
- Luna/max is the default: `luna_max` handles repository search, diff analysis, code or documentation changes, tests, GitHub CLI preparation, and issue/PR drafts; `luna_review` handles independent review. Follow the parallel dispatch contract and keep scopes separate.
- Astra is limited to task framing, final scope and safety approval, and public repository creation, push, merge, or permission execution.
- While Luna works, Astra does not repeat the same scope; independent work units may be delegated to Luna in parallel.
- Never publish secrets, local configuration, credentials, or an unreviewed backlog.

## Compatibility note

The global Codex configuration requests `model_context_window = 1_000_000` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900_000` for Astra and all five canonical Luna roles. The current local model catalog may clamp that request to `max_context_window = 872_000` with an effective runtime compaction limit of `828_400`. Role files do not override these settings.
